# CREDIT CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT

## Using K-means clustering to segmenting credit cutomer based on their characteristic.

Risk management is one of the efforts made by a company, especially those engaged in the credit sector, such as banks. One thing that can be done is to look at the potential for a customer to experience default or not based on the parameters that exist in the customer, such as age, housing status, the number of jobs, type of savings, and checking account, duration of credit repayments, and the purpose of the credit itself. The analysis carried out on these attributes is then taken into consideration whether the credit proposed by the customer is approved or not. This time, I will segment customers based on their characteristics so that an initial analysis can be carried out on whether these customers have the potential to have bad credit or not.
